## Overview

Start a Node.js server that will act as a back-end for receiving a search query for a city. Upon the query, process the query and return data to the front-end regarding the city's location and weather.

### Getting Started

    Deploy a server through Node.js and Express.

    Get query and process query through a function that obtains data from .json files that contain location and weather data.

    Return the results through a response to the front-end.

    Test output by deploying the back-end and aplying it to the front end to see if weather and location data are being shown on the front-end.
